# Welcome to our group project: cppConomy

With this cli tool we can see the effect of changing any economic variables on our small virtual world with farmers, workers, owners and markets.

Be your own government!

To download:

```
git clone https://github.com/Shafin2954/cppConomy.git
```
Or download the zip and extract. Then build using:

```
g++ -o cppConomy src/*.cpp
```

Run the program  by:
```
./cppConomy
```

Features need to be fined tuned more, still developing!
